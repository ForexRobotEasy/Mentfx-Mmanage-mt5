# Mentfx Mmanage mt5

This code is a trading robot designed to automate and enhance the trading process in the Forex Market. It incorporates a 'Drag and Drop Trade Manager' feature, advanced targeting capabilities, and the ability to manage trades during off-hours. The robot supports both market orders and limit orders, considering the spread in decision-making processes.

## Expert initialization function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. This is where necessary initialization code should be added.

## Expert deinitialization function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. This is where necessary cleanup code should be added.

## Expert start function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the price. This is where the trading logic should be implemented.

The trade manager is checked if it is enabled using the `IsTradeManagerEnabled()` function. If enabled, the user-defined entry point is obtained using the `GetEntryPoint()` function. Based on the entry point, a market order or limit order is placed using the `PlaceMarketOrder()` or `PlaceLimitOrder()` functions respectively.

If advanced targeting is enabled, portions of the trade are closed using the `ClosePortionsOfTrade()` function.

## Check if advanced targeting is enabled

The `IsTargetingEnabled()` function is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual code to check if advanced targeting is enabled.

## Close portions of trade based on targeting
